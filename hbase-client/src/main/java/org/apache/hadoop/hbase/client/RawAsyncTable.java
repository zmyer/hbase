 * A low level asynchronous table.

 * The returned {@code CompletableFuture} will be finished directly in the rpc framework's callback
 * thread, so typically you should not do any time consuming work inside these methods, otherwise
 * you will be likely to block at least one connection to RS(even more if the rpc framework uses
 * NIO).
 * <p>
 * So, only experts that want to build high performance service should use this interface directly,
 * especially for the {@link #scan(Scan, RawScanResultConsumer)} below.
 * <p>
 * TODO: For now the only difference between this interface and {@link AsyncTable} is the scan
 * method. The {@link RawScanResultConsumer} exposes the implementation details of a scan(heartbeat)
 * so it is not suitable for a normal user. If it is still the only difference after we implement
 * most features of AsyncTable, we can think about merge these two interfaces.
